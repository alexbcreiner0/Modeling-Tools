    values: [unrestricted, fixed_real_wage, nondecreasing_employment, fixed_struggle]
    tooltip: Various restrictions which we may impose upon the economy. Fixed struggle
      combines a fixed money wage with non-decreasing employment. This could represent
      an economy in which the 'yellow' labor unions have significant institutional
      power and are able to keep the class struggle locked in a stalemate.

    values: [relative, absolute, cross-dual]
    tooltip: Wright's original thesis uses an output equation in which the relative
      change in output is proportional to the profit rate. In his newer versions he
      has changed this to having the absolute output being proportional to the total
      profit. I'm not sure which I prefer so I am including both. If you aren't sure,
      leave this alone.

      of unemployment. If set to the latter, wage will only begin to decay after unemployment
      reaches the amount $\gamma_L$
  mu_L:

    label: $\mu_L= $
    type: scalar
    param_name: mu_L
    range: [0, 1]
    scalar_type: float
    tooltip: Maximal unemployment. Population will grow initially at the rate $\alpha_l$
      but logistically approach a number such that unemployment is this (i.e. it acts
      as a ceiling). Model dynamics are virtually the same even if this number is
      effectively infinity.

    param_name: wage_deflation
    range: [-1, 1]
    scalar_type: float
    tooltip: Exogenous decay rate of the wage. Positive numbers could represent an
      economy in which the working class is continually ceding ground to the capitalists
      in the class struggle, while negative numbers could represent the reverse.

    param_name: cost_tradeoff
    label: $\epsilon_T= $

    range: [0, 1]
    scalar_type: float
    tooltip: In the case of CULS or CSLU technical change, either capital or labor
      requirements increase along with the other decreasing. No matter what, the innovation
      must be cost-reducing for the capitalist. This number controls how slim the
      margin is of that cost-saving. Lower numbers mean slimmer margins means weaker
      super-profits and a less extreme effect of the innovation on the economy.
