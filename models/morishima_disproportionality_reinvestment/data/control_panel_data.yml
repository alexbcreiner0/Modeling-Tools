    param_name: "money_reinvestment"
    label: "Reinvestment Model"
    names: ["Fixed Percentage of Surplus", "Fixed Percentage of Profit"]
    values: [False, True]
    tooltip: 'Choose whether capitalists are reinvesting a fixed proportion of their surplus value vs whether they are reinvesting a fixed proportion of their money profit (more realistic).'
  force_balanced:
    control_type: "dropdown"
    param_name: "balanced"
    label: "Balanced Growth"
    names: ["Force", "Don't Force"]
    values: [True, False]
    tooltip: "Force one of the initial outputs to a number such that balanced growth is guaranteed. Warning: The balanced growth is only exact in the case of the simulation mode being set to 'exact'. This is because the matrix exponential method is approximate, and cannot maintain itself on the ultra-precise balanced growth path forever."

    values: ["y1", "y2"]
    tooltip: "If y1 is chosen and balanced growth is being forced, then y2 will be set to what it needs to be to ensure it given y1. If y2 is chosen and balanced growth is forced than y1 is changed."

    values: [False, True]
    tooltip: 'The choice of matrix exponential actually makes the curves plotted according to a stepwise computer simulation. Choosing analytic just plots the closed form solution. The former case is only approximate, but lends itself well to alterations and intervention (see the parameters r and s below).'

    param_name: "enforce_population_constraints"
    names: ["True", "False"]
    values: [True, False]
    tooltip: 'Only relevant in the case of the simulation mode set to matrix exponential. A population slider is present below. This prevents outputs from going so high that employment exceeds the available labor for hire.'
