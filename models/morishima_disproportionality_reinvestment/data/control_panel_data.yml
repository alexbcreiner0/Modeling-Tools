  title: Parameters
row1:
  money_reinvestment:
    control_type: dropdown
    param_name: money_reinvestment
    label: Reinvestment Model
    names: [Fixed Percentage of Surplus, Fixed Percentage of Profit]
    values: [false, true]
    tooltip: Choose whether capitalists are reinvesting a fixed proportion of their
      surplus value vs whether they are reinvesting a fixed proportion of their money
      profit (more realistic).
  balanced:
    control_type: dropdown
    param_name: balanced
    label: Balanced Growth
    names: [Force, Don't Force]
    values: [true, false]
    tooltip: 'Force one of the initial outputs to a number such that balanced growth
      is guaranteed. Warning: The balanced growth is only exact in the case of the
      simulation mode being set to ''exact''. This is because the matrix exponential
      method is approximate, and cannot maintain itself on the ultra-precise balanced
      growth path forever.'
  balanced_indep:
    control_type: dropdown
    label: Independent variable for balancing
    param_name: balanced_indep
    names: [Dept. I independent, Dept. II independent]
    values: [y1, y2]
    tooltip: If y1 is chosen and balanced growth is being forced, then y2 will be
      set to what it needs to be to ensure it given y1. If y2 is chosen and balanced
      growth is forced than y1 is changed.
row2:
  analytic_soln:
    control_type: dropdown
    label: Simulation Type
    param_name: analytic_soln
    names: [Matrix Exponential, Analytic]
    values: [false, true]
    tooltip: The choice of matrix exponential actually makes the curves plotted according
      to a stepwise computer simulation. Choosing analytic just plots the closed form
      solution. The former case is only approximate, but lends itself well to alterations
      and intervention (see the parameters r and s below).
  enforce_nonneg:
    control_type: dropdown
    label: Enforce Non-negative Value Output
    param_name: enforce_nonneg
    names: ['True', 'False']
    values: [true, false]
    tooltip: Only relevant in the case of the simulation mode set to matrix exponential.
      Does what it says - prevents any value outputs from becoming negative, which
      is semantically meaningless.
  enforce_population_constraints:
    control_type: dropdown
    label: Enforce Full Employment Ceiling
    param_name: enforce_population_constraints
    names: ['True', 'False']
    values: [true, false]
    tooltip: Only relevant in the case of the simulation mode set to matrix exponential.
      A population slider is present below. This prevents outputs from going so high
      that employment exceeds the available labor for hire.
row3:
  T:
    control_type: entry_block
    param_name: T
    label: $T= $
    type: scalar
    range: [0, 100]
    scalar_type: int
    tooltip: How many production periods worth of time to simulate.
  dt:
    control_type: entry_block
    param_name: dt
    label: $dt= $
    type: scalar
    range: [0, 0.1]
    scalar_type: float
    tooltip: Resolution of the simulation/plots. Lower numbers mean higher numbers
      of points sampled. Don't set it with too many zeros or your simulation will
      go on forever.
  y1i:
    control_type: entry_block
    param_name: y1i
    label: $y_1(0)= $
    type: scalar
    range: [0, 500]
    scalar_type: float
    tooltip: Initial value output for dept. I.
row4:
  y2i:
    control_type: entry_block
    param_name: y2i
    label: $y_2(0)= $
    type: scalar
    range: [0, 500]
    scalar_type: float
    tooltip: Initial value output for dept. II.
  e:
    control_type: entry_block
    param_name: e
    label: $e= $
    tooltip: Rate of exploitation. Fixed and constant.
    type: scalar
    range: [0, 5]
    scalar_type: float
  a:
    control_type: entry_block
    param_name: a
    label: $a= $
    tooltip: Rate of reinvestment. Capitalists wish to reinvest $a\times 100 \%$ of
      their surplus value/money profit each period, fully determining the output paths.
    type: scalar
    range: [0, 1]
    scalar_type: float
row5:
  k1:
    control_type: entry_block
    param_name: k1
    label: $k_1= $
    tooltip: Composition of capital for dept. I. Fixed and constant.
    type: scalar
    range: [0, 100]
    scalar_type: float
  k2:
    control_type: entry_block
    param_name: k2
    label: $k_2= $
    tooltip: Composition of capital for dept. II. Fixed and constant.
    type: scalar
    range: [0, 100]
    scalar_type: float
  r:
    control_type: entry_block
    param_name: r
    label: $r= $
    type: scalar
    range: [0, 1]
    scalar_type: float
    tooltip: Rate of reproduction for the employed working class. Each period, the
      employed population will grow at this rate.
row6:
  s:
    control_type: entry_block
    param_name: s
    label: $s= $
    type: scalar
    range: [0, 1]
    scalar_type: float
    tooltip: Attrition rate for unemployed workers. Each period, this proportion of
      the unemployed population will 'die', shrinking the available labor force.
  N0:
    param_name: N0
    control_type: entry_block
    label: $N(0)= $
    tooltip: Initial number of workers in the economy.
    type: scalar
    range: [0, 200]
    scalar_type: int
