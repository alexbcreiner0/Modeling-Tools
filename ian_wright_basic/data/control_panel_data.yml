# This yaml file contains a per-row specification of the widgets which are to appear in the control panel.
# A control widget at present is assumed to always associate with a specific parameter of the model. 
# The yaml name is not important, but the param_name MUST perfectly match the name of the associated parameter
# Program will crash if there is not a label or tooltip field, but you can leave it blank. 
# There are three types: matrix, vector, and scalar. Different widgets will be created depending on the type.
# If your control widget is a matrix or a vector, then the dimension of the matrix dim MUST be specified.
# For a matrix, the dim needs to be a list, e.g. [3,3] for a 3x3 matrix. For a vector, it just needs to be an integer
# If your control widget is a scalar, then you MUST specify a slider range ([0,1] for a slider from 0 to 1) and
# a scalar_type (either "float" or "int")
